  <h2 id="title">1. Introduction to Investing in Cryptocurrency</h2>
  <p>Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that captured the
    public's attention and made people very curious about this new type of
    asset. It is a digital currency that allows people to easily buy and
    sell goods or services online, even if they don't have any bank account
    or credit card.
  </p>

  <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Cardano and Solana are some of the most
    popular cryptocurrencies available today. They have all shown great
    potential as investments.
  </p>

  <p>Numerous people have been buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies;
    however, the volatility of cryptocurrencies has been a hurdle for many
    investors, For example, Bitcoin's price reached an All Time High of
    $67,567 (ATH) November 8 , its value as in today, 19 September 2022 is
    $19,132. but this may be changing soon. As more and more people are
    starting to invest in cryptocurrencies, prices will stabilize overtime.
  </p>

  <h2 id="title">2. The Case of Inflation:</h2>
  <p>Inflation is a measure of how much the <strong>purchasing
    power</strong> of a currency decreases. It is the percentage rate at
    which the prices of goods and services are rising.
  </p>

  <p>Inflation rates are calculated by comparing the cost of a set of
    goods or services over time. The inflation rate is usually expressed as
    an annualized percentage, such as 2% per year. means that a unit of
    currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.
  </p>

  <h4 id="subtitle">What changed ?</h4>
  
  <p>The inflation rates have been on the rise in recent years, due to a
    variety of factors including increased demand for goods and services,
    higher oil prices, and quantitative easing.
  </p>
  
  <p>According to Trading Economics, it has reached an all-time high of 8.6% during last month (August 2022)</p>

  <h2 id="title">3. What can you do to protect yourself from inflation:</h2>
  <p>By investing in assets that will hold their value, investors can not
    only protect themselves from inflation but also generates a positive
    cash flow that will help them maintain their lifestyle without depending
    on a paycheck from their day jobs.
  </p>
  <p>Cryptocurrency has been around for more than a decade, but it is only
    recently that it has become a viable investment option. Cryptocurrency
    can be used to buy and sell goods or services and offers the potential
    to replace fiat currency in the future. The key component of
    cryptocurrency is that it is decentralized.
  </p>
  <p>This means that no single entity controls the cryptocurrency and
    every transaction occurs on a peer-to-peer basis. It also means that the
    price of a digital currency can fluctuate significantly and
    unpredictably, as well as not being tied to any one country's economy.
  </p>
  <p>Rather then sticking to the old methods of using saving accounts,
    crytocurrency tackle the issue with a modern approach : “Stacking”
  </p>
  <h4 id="subtitle">What is stacking ?</h4>
  <p>According to <a href="http://coinbase.com/">coinbase</a>, stacking is
    a way of earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies.
  </p>
  <h4 id="subtitle">How does Stacking work ?</h4>
    <p>Simply put, if you own a cryptocurrency that allows stacking, you can
      stake some of your holdings and earn a percentage-rate reward over
      time.
    </p>
    <p>This process usually happens via a “stacking pool” which you can
      think of as being similar to an interest-bearing savings account.
    </p>
    <p>While stacked, your crypto holdings becomes part of the process:
      Cryptocurrencies that allows stacking use a “Consensus mechanism” called proof of stake,
    </p>
    <p>which ensures that all transactions are verified and secured without
      a middle man (usually a bank or a credit card company)
    </p>
  <h4 id="subtitle">What is Proof of Stake ?</h4>
    <p>A newer consensus mechanism with the implication of increasing speed,
      efficiency and lower transction fees, In which transaction are validated
      by people who are already invested in the blockchain via stacking, their
      stacked tokens act as a guarantee of the legitimacy of any new
      transaction they add to the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>Notice : The network chooses validators based on the size and the duration of their stacking.</p>
  <h4 id="subtitle">What are the advantages of stacking ?</h4>
    <p>Long term crypto holders looks at stacking as a way of making their
      assets work for them passively by generating rewards and reinvesting
      their rewards in the same coins leading to a compound return on investment(ROI).
  <h4>Recommended staking platforms:</h4>

    volume. it allows both DeFi Stacking and Locked Stacking.

  <h3 id="title">Final thoughts:</h3>
  <p>The rewards received form stacking combined with the increasing
    exchange rates makes it a must to convert some of your investment
    portfolios to a form of cryptocurrency that supports Proof of Stake.
  </p>
  <p>Stacking is a strategy that is used by long-term holders of
    cryptocurrency and is meant to keep your assets value from depriciating over time .
  </p>
  <p>Lastly, you should always treat your assets with care: read about the
    projects you're willing to invest into, look-up their history within the
    market, their historical data..etc. before comitting to any financial
    investment.
