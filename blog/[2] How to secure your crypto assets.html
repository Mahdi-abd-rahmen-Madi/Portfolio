<h2 id="title">Introduction: What is a
Digital Asset?</h2>
<p>According to The Balance, Digital assets are anything that can be
stored and transmitted electronically through a computer or other
digital device, and are associated with ownership or use rights.
Well-known examples today include cryptocurrencies and non-fungible
tokens (NFTs). While you can’t hold digital assets with your hands, they
are real assets that you can buy, sell, store, and trade online.</p>

<p>Digital assets are intangible assets that exist in cyberspace. They
can be anything from a song to a bitcoin. Digital assets have been
around for a while now, but they are only becoming more popular as the
internet is becoming more and more pervasive in our lives. There are
many ways to protect digital assets, but the most important thing is to
know what you’re protecting and how you can protect it.</p>
<h2 id="title">Why You Should Secure Your Digital Assets Today ?</h2>
<p>The digital era has changed the way we store and share data. The
internet has made it so easy to access, store, and share information
that we often forget about the importance of protecting our data. But
with so much sensitive information stored digitally, it’s essential to
take steps to protect your digital assets and make sure they are safe
from theft or hacking.</p>
<p>This article will provide you with some tips on how to secure your
digital assets, as well as how to properly fortify your exchange
accounts.</p>
<h2 id="title">How do
cybercriminals elaborate their attack vector ?</h2>
<h3 id="subtitle">1) Social engineering attacks :</h3>
<p>The first step in protecting yourself against social engineering
attacks is recognizing them for what they are:</p>
<p><strong>Social engineering attacks</strong> are attempts by hackers
to gather information about you or your company by pretending to be
someone else. They might pretend that they’re from your bank or a
government agency, for example, in order to get you to reveal your
password or other personal information.</p>
<p>Suppose you have your crypto on coinbase.com, How do you access your
funds there? Well, you need 3 pieces of information, your username, your
password, and the two-factor authentication code.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about how they’re doing that!</p>
<h3 id="subtitle">Email address:</h3>
<p>Usually, hackers will scour through past database dumps such as the
ledger database, and they’ll usually try to create a new exchange
account with each and every email address.</p>
<p>The already created account will prompt that those email address have
already being used for Sign Up, Now they have one third of the puzzle
solved!.</p>
<h3 id="subtitle">Passwords:</h3>
<p>Next, they’ll start going to past database breaches, looking for your
email to see if it was in a breach that had your password in it, not
necessarily Coinbase database dump, but any other site that you had
registered with. And if they can find a password of yours that was in
some other data breach, they’ll grab that and check if that’s also the
same password you use on your Coinbase account. Often time, this works
because a lot of people reuse the same password for every site they have
a login for. So <strong>don’t reuse passwords</strong> ever.</p>
<p>But if they can’t find your password this way, they can get into your
email, then tell Coinbase to reset the password, which will email you
with a password reset link, so they can bypass the password all
together.</p>
<p>So this is what they’ll focus on trying to guess or reset your email
password. They might try hacking (by brute forcing) or social
engineering your email provider to get into your account. And if that
doesn’t work, they might try <strong>sim swapping</strong> you.</p>
<h3 id="subtitle">2) What is SIM Swapping ?</h3>
<p>SIM swapping is the act of hijacking your phone number to either
reset your email passwords, and from there, cybercriminals can reset
your exchange account password, or approve malicious transactions via
the SMS 2 factor-authentications code. And with that, they’ll work
quickly to take all your funds and transfer it to an external wallet
where you’ll never see that crypto again.</p>
<h3 id="subtitle">3) Phishing attacks :</h3>
<p>According to Cloudflare, Phishing attacks refers to the act of luring
victims, In an attempt to steal sensitive information, typically in the
form of usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account
information etc…</p>
<p>By masquerading as a reputable source with an enticing request, In
order to utilize or sell the stolen information, Similarly to how a
fisherman uses bait to catch a fish.</p>
<h2 id="title">So, how do you
as an End-User defend against this?</h2>
<h3 id="subtitle">Quick tips:</h3>
<p><strong>for email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a unique email address just for your exchange or high security
accounts. You should make the email itself hard for people to
find!.</li>
<li>You can try going to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a> and type in
your email to see what sites have leaked your data.</li>
<li>Having a clean email address that isn’t used anywhere else makes it
much harder for attackers to find.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For passwords:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a random password Generator from A FOSS Cross-platform Password
Manager such as <a href="https://keepassxc.org/"><strong>KeepassXC</strong></a></li>
<li>Don’t reuse passwords, especially those that you use on your crypto
exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For 2 factor-authentications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use SMS based two-factor authentication, Instead, use
something like KeePassXC TOTP, Binance Authenticator or Google
authenticator.</li>
<li>Be aware of the kind of damage that a sim swap can cause you, and
take steps needed to protect against it.</li>
<li>Store your digital assets in a hardware wallet like <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a> or <a href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a> and lock it up in a safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="title">Important!</h2>
<p>Secure your exchange accounts even if they’re empty, those account
can be linked to your bank account, so when maliciously accessed, third
parties can buy crypto on your behalf and deposit them into their own
wallets.</p>
<p>Note that you either need a Private Key or a Seed Phrase to get
control of a wallet, So never ever let the seed phrase or the Private
Key get out of your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Store them digitally anywhere</strong>, Neither, in the
clouds, nor emails to yourself.</p>
<p>The only place to ever enter them is in your wallet when you are
setting up your wallet for the first time. Never ever give it to anyone
or enter it into any website ever.</p>
<p>I personally recommend having 2 or more wallets, one as a long term
vault, and another one for minting or everyday use.</p>
<p>The everyday use one should have a small amount of crypto (less than
$300 worth of assets).</p>
<p>The long term vault should be a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger),
where you store your long term holdings, and this one should only be
used to send your crypto assets to and from your other wallets.</p>
<h2 id="title">What
Happens When You Don’t Protect Your Digital Assets?</h2>
<p>In this era of globalization and digitization, it is inevitable that
our digital assets will be exposed to different risks. In some cases,
these risks can be managed by taking simple precautions such as using
clean email addresses or even using a Password Manager for strong
password generation and 2FA setups. But even with these precautions,
there is always a chance of data being lost or stolen.</p>
<p>As we become more reliant on technology, the risk of data being lost
or stolen increases. With one third of Americans reporting that they
have had their information hacked in the last year, it’s not surprising
to see that many companies are hesitant to store sensitive information
online.</p>
<h2 id="title">Conclusion
and Takeaway : Securing Your Digital Assets in our Connected World:</h2>
<p>We have seen how the digital era has shifted the balance of power
from governments to corporations, and we are now in a world where people
are more empowered than ever.</p>
<p>The future of our digital assets is not a bright one. As we become
more connected and dependent on the internet, it is vital that we take
measures to protect ourselves. The first step is to educate ourselves
about cybersecurity risks, and then make an effort to secure our own
digital assets.</p>
<h2 id="title">Difficult words :</h2>
<p>Ledger : A hardware wallet that had 272,000 of their customers
details, leaked in 2020.</p>
<p>FOSS : Free Open-Source Software</p>
<p>TOTP : Time-based one-time password</p>
<p>NFT : non-fungible tokens</p>
