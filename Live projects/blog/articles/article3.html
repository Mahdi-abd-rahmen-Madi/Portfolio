    <p>When storing and managing cryptocurrency, you can choose between a
      custodial or non-custodial wallet. Custodial wallets are managed by a
      third party and offer ease of access, while non-custodial wallets offer
      greater control and security. In this article, we will compare these two
      wallet types and help you decide which is best for you.

  <h2 id="title">Introduction :</h2>
    <p>The cryptocurrency custody crisis has been a big topic of discussion
      lately. The spectacular Fallout of the FTX crypto exchange has led both
      investors and crypto enthusiasts to question the whole industry.
    </p>
    <p>In this article, we will discuss different types of crypto wallets,
      and we’ll clarify the differences between Custodial VS Non-Custodial wallets
    </p>
  <h3 id="subtitle">Let’s first understand what is a crypto wallet ?</h3>
    <p>Most people think that their crypto or tokens are inside their
      wallets, This is false! Crypto wallets don’t actually hold anything,
      Your crypto wallet is a <strong>proof of ownership</strong> through
      keys, and whoever holds those keys gets access to the assets.
    </p>
    <p>A crypto wallet is a piece of Software or Hardware that allows its
      users to store, access or withdraw funds by connecting to a particular
      Blockchain Network, a crypto wallet is a pair of 2 keys :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>public key</strong> is a long string of random letters and
          numbers that act like the home address, used to receive and deposit transaction data.
      </li>
      <li>A <strong>private key</strong> acts as the key to your front door
          and is used to prove ownership over any funds held inside, as well as
          facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrencies out of a wallet (Signing transactions)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To avoid Human errors, wallet providers like Metamask offers a secret
      recovery phrase that acts like a human-readable version of your private
      key (instead of the long string of random letters and numbers)
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to store cryptocurrency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first is through a <strong>custodial wallet</strong>, you
        entrust your private key to a third party and in return they manage your funds.
      </li>
      <li>The other way is known as <strong>non-custodial wallet</strong>, and
        these allow you to keep control of the private keys yourself, storing
        them on a secure device such as a hardware wallet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="title">What is a Custodial Wallet?</h2>
    <p>A custodial wallet is a digital wallet that is hosted and controlled
      by a third-party service : an individual, a company, an Exchange, or
      even the Government, in which the service controlling the custodial
      wallet can spend the funds in the account, but cannot withdraw them.
    </p>
  <h3 id="advantages">Advantages :</h3>
    <p>A custodial wallet is convenient because it allows you to trade your
      cryptocurrency on the exchange where the funds are stored, Custodial
      wallets allows you also to buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency while
      non-custodial wallets do not.
    </p>
    <p>You don’t need to worry about losing your private keys because they
        are stored and managed by the service provider hosting your coins.
    </p>
  <h3 id="subtitle">Inconveniences :</h3>
    <p>A custodial wallet can be seen as a bank account, where the bank owns
      and controls all of your money, but you have access to it via an online interface.
    </p>
    <p>In this case, you are not controlling your own money and are at risk
      of losing it if the company goes bankrupt or gets hacked.
    </p>
  <h3 id="subtitle">Note :</h3>
    <p>You can store your cryptocurrency in a non-custodial wallet as well,
      but you will have to generate and store your private keys yourself,
      which can be inconvenient and risky if not done correctly.
    </p>
  <h2 id="title">What is a Non-Custodial Wallet?</h2>
    <p>A non-custodial wallet is a digital wallet that you have full control
      of, that is not governed and managed by a third party: You have the
      private keys for your wallet, and you can control your own funds.
    </p>
    <p>A non-custodial doesn’t fall under the KYC standard, meaning that you
      don’t have to give up any personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>Non-custodial wallets are more secure because they are decentralized
      and cannot be hacked as easily as custodial wallets.
    </p>
  <h2 id="title">The Difference Between Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets :</h2>
    <p>Non-custodial wallets allow you to control the private key. This
      means that if you lose access to your non-custodial wallet, you still
      have full control over your funds and can retrieve them with your private key.
    </p>
    <p>This enables you to fully participate on the blockchain network:
      Ethereum or any other network, directly without approval and without an intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>The big difference is that you, and only you, hold and control your private keys.</p>
    <p>This means you could never be denied access to your assets, and can
      participate fully on the network.
    </p>
    <p>Custodial wallets provide access to liquidity, especially when
      dealing with fiat currencies via bank transfers or P2P.
    </p>
    <p>While non-custodial wallets offer more privacy on transactions due to
      the lack of a central entity managing them and more security in case of hacking attacks.
    </p>
  <h2 id="title">Conclusion: “Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins!”</h2>
    <p>Lately, The custody crisis affecting cryptocurrency has been a major concern for investors and traders.</p>
    <p>While storing your cryptos in a custodial wallet might seem the way
      to go for day trading, buying cryptos with fiat, bank transfers … The flaws outweigh the benefit :
    </p>
    <p>Storing your cryptocurrency on an internet connected device exposes
      you to a variety of risks (smart contract vulnerabilities, The exchange
      goes offline or hold crypto withdrawal …)
    </p>
    <p>The safest way to store cryptocurrencies is with a hardware wallet
      that is disconnected from the internet through a non-custodial wallet:
    </p>
    <p>A Non-Custodial wallet allows you to access your digital assets
      anytime, as well as ensures that you don’t lose your money even when a
      smart contract vulnerability occurs (Infinite Token Approvals) You can
      defend against such vulnerability via a Custom Spend Limit.
    </p>
    <p>And while there are no better ways to store your crypto than in a
      safe and private wallet, you should be aware that this system is subject
      to hacks or theft, by getting access to your secret recovery phrase or
      your private key, cybercriminals can have ownership of your assets.
    </p>
    <p>In the next article, We will cover potential attacks and
      vulnerabilities around Non-Custodial wallet, as well as the best
      practices to set up and use such wallet.
